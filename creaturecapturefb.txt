Good use of static constants for costs, but should be defined in the Player class (in other words, the app should not need to know that). -3

Also, should not hardwire thresholds for Creature (5, 10, etc.). These should be constants in Creature class. -2

Also, the Creature should be responsible for generating its own initial speed and strength.
